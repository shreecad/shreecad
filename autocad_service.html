              <h3>Cad Profile : Our production Procedures:</h3>
              These Projects normally vary from 1 to 2 drawings / maps. These are the benchmark drawings / maps sent by our clients Standards and Quality of our work. These projects may decide
              future orders and company reputation with the clients. Sample drawings will be strictly adhered to specifications. The job will be carried out as per the conversion process and tested and delivered.
               Whatever may be the size of the project.

              <h3>The following are the steps to ensure quality as described below.</h3>

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   Specification tools to be used if any<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   Data formats for the deliverables<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   Any other technical or non-technical information which client feels necessary
                  to be incorporated in the projects.<br/><br/>
                </li>

                <li>THE SPECIFICATIONS MAY DIFFER FROM CLIENT TO CLIENT AND PROJECT TO PROJECT:<br/><br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• These specifications are analyzed. Discussed and reviewed in a review meeting.<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Then the specifications will be briefed to the production team before carrying out the conversion activity.<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Team Leaders/Manager Will does the process of analyzing specification
                  and briefing.<br/><br/>
                </li>

                <li>CHANGES IN THE SPECIFICATIONS:<br/>
                  At times, during the course of process, client may request change/update the specification or give some special instructions. In such cases:<br/><br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   A review meeting will be organized.<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   New specifications will be analyzed for the feasibility.<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   Any such changes will be documented in requirement specifications as appendix.<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   The new specifications will be briefed to the production team.<br/><br/>

                  Some times, during verification of the drawings by the client, the client may request change/update textual   specification after the delivers also. In such cases the manager will review the new specifications and take a decision on feasibility of incorporating these changes.<br/><br/>
                </li>

                <li>PRODUCTION PHASES:<br/>
                  The project will go through the following phases:<br/><br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   Production Planning<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   Pre-processing<br/>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   Conversion<br/>

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•   Delivery<br/><br/>
                </li>

                <li>PRODUCTION SCHEDULING AND TRACKING:<br/>
                      To ensure consistent quality and optimum utilization of available resources, Project Tracking plays a crucial role. Each drawing file is tracked against Job allocation and Project Track sheets, which gives the status of the completed files, Work-in-progress files and new files. The project Team leader will fill in the Project Track Sheet with details Such as File Name, Project Name, Batch No. And Date started so that We can track the project at any given time.<br/><br/>
                </li>

                <li>JOB WORK ORDER SECURITY:<br/>

                <li><b>TEST PLAN : </b>
                      The Test Plan for the conversion activity will consist of Screen Check, paper check, Vector Correction and Final Quality Check.<br/><br/>
                </li>

                <li>SCREEN CHECK :
                      To check the converted vector drawing on screen for missing entities/mistakes 100% layerization with reference to the given drawing. This is the self-check carried
                      at the operator level and subsequent to Production.<br/><br/>
                </li>

                <li>PAPER CHECK :
                      This process starts after Screen Check to identify any errors and missing entiti
                      print drawings for further correction. The Team leaders carry out this check.<br/><br/>
                </li>

                <li>VECTOR CORRECTION :
                      This is the correction done in the soft copy by comparing the Red marked items in the Paper check print drawings marked by the Project Team Leaders. Operators carry out this correction work in the guidance of the Project Team Leaders.<br/><br/>
                </li>

                <li>FINAL QUALITY CHECK :
                      After receiving the drawings, plots, vector plots from the production; QC team will start final QC. The checking includes text mistakes, drawing mistakes, snapping and so on. Check also includes layerization, proper drawings name, and paper drawing borders Title Block Information. This check will ensure that the conversion is fully according to the client’s specifications and requirements. Upon completing all the above said Quality checks, ENCODED Information will be DECODED according to the client’s specification, which will be exclusively done by the Project Manager.<br/><br/>
                </li>

                <li>DELIVERY
                      Deliveries will be done as per the customer’s request and in the specified format.<br/><br/>
