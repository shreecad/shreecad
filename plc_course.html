            P.L.C Automation Training & Consultancy Organisations that have recently 
            invested in modern automated plants will find that most of their control panels will include a PLC. 
            It is beneficial for all Maintenance Technicians to have an understanding of  PLC systems for the following reasons.
            <ul>
              <li>If no back up program is obtained and the PLC crashes the plant can be off line for a long period for reprogramming. </li>
              <li>A first check can be made to see if a fault lies with the PLC, this can assist the fault finding process.</li>
              <li>The PLC program can be modified to make the plant to run more efficiently. </li>
              <li>The use of the PLC laptop can greatly speed up a plant fault finding process. </li>
            </ul>
