            P.L.C Automation Training & Consultancy Organisations that have recently 
            invested in modern automated plants will find that most of their control panels will include a PLC. 
            It is beneficial for all Maintenance Technicians to have an understanding of  PLC systems for the following reasons.
            <ul>
              <li>If no back up program is obtained and the PLC crashes the plant can be off line for a long period for reprogramming. </li>
              <li>A first check can be made to see if a fault lies with the PLC, this can assist the fault finding process.</li>
              <li>The PLC program can be modified to make the plant to run more efficiently. </li>
              <li>The use of the PLC laptop can greatly speed up a plant fault finding process. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>PLC Training Courses:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Introduction to PLC Training -Ideal for people wanting more information on how a PLC works, Basic programming.</li> 
              <li>Training for Engineers - PLC Programming For maintenance and people who intend to work and program PLC's. No experience necessary. </li>
              <li>Extended PLC Training - PLC Programming Extend your knowledge and skill level, learn how to write process control  routines and design programs from the start to the end. </li>
              <li>Advanced PLC Training - PLC Programming, This training course is more advanced and teaches you more advanced PLC  instructions and how to apply them when creating programs to control: Traffic, Robotic Control, Data Buffers, Mathematical conversions. </li>
              <li>Learn what a PLC is – “Programmable Logic Controller”, used extensively throughout industry worldwide, the “PLC” controls much of our daily lives, from Food & Drink manufacture, Oil, Rail, Nuclear, Airports, Traffic Management etc.</li>
